<p>BertopicR is a package that allows us to use the Python BERTopic
package in r. To do this we need to leverage the reticulate library
which allows us to embed a python session within our r session. Firstly,
we load our libraries. <strong>Note:</strong> Always load BertopicR
before loading reticulate, if you get an error about python version
discrepencies, restart your r session.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html" class="external-link">library</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va"><a href="https://jpcompartir.github.io/BertopicR/">BertopicR</a></span><span class="op">)</span></span>

<p>Then check that our environment has been configured correctly</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/check_python_dependencies.html">check_python_dependencies</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; bertopic is installed, setup looks good.</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can import the python BERTopic library through BertopicR via
reticulate</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu">BertopicR</span><span class="fu">:::</span><span class="fu">import_bertopic</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can look at what’s been loaded in. The “py” prefix tells r
that we want to look within the python environment. We should see a
vector containing: backend; BERTopic; cluster; plotting; representation;
vectorizers</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>Other than spam and duplicate post removal, there is no data
preprocessing strictly required for topic analysis using BERT. That
said, I have found better results by removing hashtags and it can be
useful to remove mentions, urls and emojis at this stage as, assuming
these are not important parts of your analysis, it should not affect the
results and will be helpful when looking at the data later. We can use
the ParseR clean_text function to do this (<em>note that this function
removes urls</em>).</p>
<p>Load and preprocess the data:</p>

<p>Next we use the bt_fit_transform_model() function to fit the model to
our data. This function returns a list containing both the fitted model
and the embeddings used to generate the model.</p>

<p>Now that we have fit the model we can look at the topics it has
predicted for our data. The -1 category here represents outlier posts
that do not fit as well into the identified topics.</p>

<p>Bert has identified 95 topics, excluding outliers, this is probably
too many for us to process and perform meaningful analysis on, we can
adjust the model parameters so that a more manageable number of topics
are identified. It can be helpful to glance through all of these topics
in order to get a more granular understanding of the data and to
identify topics which might be irrelevant to the analysis and could be
removed.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="adjusting-model-parameters">Adjusting Model Parameters<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#adjusting-model-parameters"></a>
</h2>
<p>When creating the model, we can alter the min_topic_size arguments to
control the number of posts required per topic. We can also specify the
ngram_range and diversity parameters to control the size and diversity
of the ngrams used to represent the topics and set stopwords to TRUE to
prevent stopwords appearing in the representative ngrams (Note that this
does not remove them from the text being analysed, only from the ngrams
used to describe the topics). It is also possible to use the nr_topics
argument to specify the exact number of topics we would like the model
to output however this should not be done without careful examination of
the data.</p>
<p>If you have run the bt_fit_transform_model() function yourself at all
you might have noticed that you can get very different results each time
you run it, this is due to the stochastic nature of umap, to avoid this
we can specify a random state which prevents any stochastic behaviour
and gives reproducible results. Reproducing your results can also be
achieved by saving your model and reusing it, it is completely fine to
run the model a number of times to see what topics are output and save
the model which you feel best fits your research.</p>
<p>As we have already run this bt_fit_transform_model() on the same
data, we can simply feed the already saved embedding to the model, this
time the bt_fit_transform_model function will only output a bertopic
model, not the embeddings.</p>
<p>Note: More information on hyperparameter tuning can be found on the
BERTopic website</p>

<p>Now we might need to take a closer look at each topic to understand
better what they are about. To do this we use the bt_make_df() function
to merge the bert results with the Sprinklr export. We can then look at
topics using ParseR to create bigrams, the BertopicR function
bt_viz_top_terms() to create a top terms plot or look at exemplars by
filtering the df to the topic we’re interested in.</p>

<p>As with SegmentR, both all_terms and max_only plots are returned and
we can choose to display these charts with a bar or lollipop viz and
pluck either all_terms or max_only if we wish.</p>

<p>If we want to look at exemplars we can simply filter the
dataframe:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb16"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>We can also look at a umap that shows us the topic distribution. This
can be helpful in showing us how closely different topics relate to one
another and we should continue to check this diagram as we merge topics
or reduce outliers. We can use LandscapeR or the bertopic umap viz to
achieve this.</p>

king of falador needs an appropriate name. let's call my ex, who at the time i was still friends with, josh. and my insane best friend at the time, let's call her crazy, because i can't think of anything else that would suit her. \nour starts when josh and i were in 9th grade and crazy and fritz were in 8th grade. 9th grade is high school in our town, so me and josh went there but we'd gone to the same middle school as crazy and fritz, so we all knew each other.\nme and fritz had been friends for a while, and he once put a letter in my locker, when i was still in middle school, that i still have to this day. i read it now and then trying  to figure out what it ment. it puzzles me to this day. it read, \"you have potential but you need to work on your personality. i can help you. tell no one of this [winky face]\". worst love letter i'd ever received. at that time, josh and i were still dating, so i ignored it.\nonce i was in high school, some time after home coming, me and josh broke up. it wasn't a bad breakup, we just decided to be friends. it wasn't until valentines day that i started dating fritz after giving him a box of chocolate and he took it as more than it was. he amused that ment we were dating and i was like, ok whatever.\nit was over the next few weeks that i realized that the things fritz had always talked about wasn't a joke. he was obsessed with germany. not the culture, or distant history. he was obsessed with nazi germany, and talked all the time about how hitler was such a genius and how his vision was never realized. this should've been a red flag, but i was young and stupid. \nwe both liked playing runescape. he had membership, and talked about all sorts of things that i at first believed because i was playing on the free servers. he claimed to be king of falador. for those of you who don't know what runescape is, falador is a city in the game that just so happens to have literal white-knights. that is, knights in white armor. in runescape, you don't get to become a king or anything like that. but he wore this ring, he probably got from hot topic, that had a little golden crown on it. \nhe also thought that he had to keep his blood pure, and wanted to date me because i had pale eyes, like his, and that ment our child would have pale eyes. i broke it to him that i had a good bit of hispanic heritage and distant native american in me. he was annoyed by it, and said if our child came out too dark he'd leave me, but since i was \"passing\" for white, that i \"would do\". this puzzled me at first, but alarmed josh, who didn't really like fritz. it all came to a head on my birthday, in early march. i was hanging out with crazy at first. it was the weekend, and we had spent the night at her house watching movies. we at first met up with fritz the next day to just walk around town. then we ran into josh and some other friends of ours. josh split off to hang out with us eventually. he had his beebee gun with him, and that got crazy's attention. she started shooting josh and fritz with it. josh didn't care because he was wearing cloths thick enough to not feel it, but fritz got really mad. he charged after her at one point and i grabbed his arm to stop him. he pulled away and turned on me, putting his hand around my throat and screaming at me that he wouldn't let some girl treat him like that. he went after her again and i tackled him to the ground. josh took the gun from crazy at this point. while i had fritz in a headlock my army dad taught me i yelled at him that i was breaking up with him and to leave me alone and never talk to me again. \nhe just layed there after that. josh, crazy and i went back to my house, were i just sat fuming on my sofa. we weren't there for half an hour before fritz was pounding on my door. i told him he'd better leave before my army dad got home and i told him what he'd done to me. he got very pale, even for his pasty self. he left, and we went back in. not a moment later, but the neighbor kid from next door came knocking to tell me that fritz was trying to hang himself in my other neighbor's tree with his shoe string. josh ran out to cut him down. i sat on the porch just watching with crazy, who didn't blame herself one bit. she said he was bound to snap eventually, and to be honest she was right. \nthe fire department and police showed up and took fritz away, and i hoped that would be the end of it. \nin our school, 9th graders had their own building at the high school. so when i was in 10th grade, and fritz was in 9th, we didn't see each other, and i was so glad. until one day he decided to get on my bus. i noticed right away he'd grown a neck beard, and had also invested in a trench coat. he had the nerve to sit down next to me and i took a look at him, said not a word, and jumped over the seat to get away from him. i told the school the next day, and how i didn't want him near me. they told him he was not allowed on my bus, that he shouldn't have been on in the first place anyway. they didn't know how they were going to handle it when he came over to the main campus that following year but i ended up moving and he was sent to

 the us entered the mexican-american war in response to the alamo (which technically wasn't american, texas was independent at the time), wwii in response to pearl harbor and the afghanistan war in response to 9/11, but after these inciting incidents all of the fighting occurred on foreign soil.  what i'm getting at is that the us has never fought a true defensive war.  they have fought to protect their allies, to expand their territory, and to protect their interests abroad, but never in true self-defense.\n\ni also object to the idea that there is only one day on which their deeds are recognized.  if you're close with any veterans, how often are they thanked for their service by civilians once said civilian learns of their military background?  probably pretty often, right?  and it's not just on veteran's day.  also, the response to the controversies surrounding the pledge of allegiance and the us national anthem tells us that many americans believe that taking part in these rituals also expresses thanks and recognition to veterans.  gratitude towards veterans for their service is a 24/7/365 cultural norm for americans. \n\nokay, so what about the gay people?  i think comparing them to veterans is a bit odd, when a more apt comparison would be to other historically marginalized groups.  indeed, what we find is that the lgbt movement gets no more recognition than african-americans (black history month), women (women's history month), or hispanic and latino people (hispanic heritage month).  veterans are a minority too, demographically, but they are also a distinct category from these other groups, not to mention that they've been held in high regard throughout american history with the brief exception during the vietnam war.   but if you're saying that lgbt people should only get a day, you're by proxy devaluing the other months we've set aside for other civil rights movements, as well.  \n\nmy biggest question, though, is what would having a veteran's month accomplish?  there's a veteran suicide epidemic in the us that civilians aren't talking about, a lack of support for veterans with disabling injuries from war, a lack of good job opportunities for veterans, and an appalling proportion of veterans who are homeless.  the same body that has the ability to create and solemnize these \"special months\" (the us government) also has the power to play an active role in solving all of the above problems veterans face.  creating a month for veterans and calling it a done deal is going to result in more national anthems and no less veteran suicides.","these short videos were part of a social media campaign that i worked on with the city of inglewood for hispanic heritage month. my task was to highlight impactful persons of (excuse the ","i'm totally fine with supporting hispanic heritage and all of that. but this one went overboard for me. it should be changed back. \n\ncesar chavez was a cool guy and did a lot for migrant workers. my grandmother (a apwu president in the '80s) even had a picture of him holding me as a baby but it was lost. i think he's a great guy. \n\ni would be totally fine with them renaming it when they did if it were a local figure. but around the time they renamed it, it was just virtue signaling (yeah, i hate that i said that too). i remember around the same time that they wanted to name our airport the cesar chavez international airport. \n\nagain, he was a great guy and stood up for the hispanic/migrant \nfarm workers and i wish there were more people alive now like him to make the same stand against the industries that use them to make profits.\n\nbut we just should have kept it as durango. most young people have no idea who cesar chavez is now. when i was growing up he was brought up a lot. maybe it's just a coincidence or maybe it's complacency because we named a street after him.","we celebrate the heritage of all our adult esol students.\nhere's to latino pride! youtu.be/ficuswmst1u\nmore info about classes fcps.edu/node/33027\n     ","whites treat me like i'm white because i look white and they treat me that way right up until they learn that i have strong hispanic heritage and speak a lot of spanish.

<p>Now that we have a better idea of what each topic is about, maybe now
we would like to manually merge some topics that we think might be
similar and reduce the size of the outlier category (-1).
<strong>Merging topics should be performed before outlier
reduction</strong>.</p>
<p>We can see from the tree diagram where we visualise the topic
hierarchy that topic 4 and topic 0 are branches from the same cluster,
having looked at the individual documents and bigrams it is apparent
that they both discuss hispanic heritage, it might make sense to merge
these. Make sure to save your model before merging topics in case you
are unhappy with the result and want to revert back.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> the topics to merge must be given to the merge_topics
function as a python list of integers. To do this we convert an r vector
to a python list using the r_to_py() function and the “L” suffix to
denote an integer.</p>

<p>If we are unhappy with the new topics we can always go back to the
original model. We need to use the “py$” suffix to access libraries in
the python environment.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb23"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">model_og</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="va">py</span><span class="op">$</span><span class="va">bertopic</span><span class="op">$</span><span class="va">BERTopic</span><span class="op">$</span><span class="fu">load</span><span class="op">(</span>path <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"BertopicR_example.bt"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we are happy with the merged topics we can look at reducing
some of the “outliers”. It is up to you how important this is for your
project, perhaps it is more important to get really high quality topics
at the expense of some of the data or maybe it is important to include
as much of the data as possible at the expense of resolution. In this
example we are going to use the “embeddings” strategy, but there are
lots of different strategies which can be used for doing this that you
can find here: <a href="https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/getting_started/outlier_reduction/outlier_reduction.html#exploration" class="external-link uri">https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/getting_started/outlier_reduction/outlier_reduction.html#exploration</a></p>
<p>In order to correctly reassign topics from outliers we need to tell
the function which document belongs to which topic, to do this we can
use the df output from the bt_make_df function, but remember that if you
have merged topics since generating the df, you will need to run it
again to update the topics in the table. You can play around with the
threshold parameter to adjust the number of reassigned documents, it
refers to the minimum similarity between a document and a topic for it
to be reassigned to that topic and the correct value is entirely
dependent on the dataset and your specifications for the project.</p>
