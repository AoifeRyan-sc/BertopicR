\arguments{
\item{...}{Sent to bertopic.representation OpenAI() function for adding additional arguments}

\item{openai_model}{openai model to use. If using a gpt-3.5 model, set chat = TRUE}

\item{nr_docs}{The number of documents to pass to OpenAI if a prompt with the ["DOCUMENTS"] tag is used.}

\item{api_key}{openai ai api authentication key. This can be found on your openai account.}

\item{exponential_backoff}{Retry requests with a random exponential backoff.
A short sleep is used when a rate limit error is hit, then the requests is retried.
Increase the sleep length if errors are hit until 10 unsuccessful requests.
If True, overrides delay_in_seconds.}

\item{chat}{set to TRUE if using gpt-3.5 model}

\item{delay_in_seconds}{The delay in seconds between consecutive prompts, this is to avoid rate limit errors.}

\item{prompt}{The prompt to be used with the openai model. If NULL, the default prompt is used.}

\value{
OpenAI representation model
}
\description{
Uses the OpenAI API to generate topic labels based on one of their Completion
(chat = FALSE) or ChatCompletion (chat = TRUE) models.
